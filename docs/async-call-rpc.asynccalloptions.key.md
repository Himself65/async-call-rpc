## AsyncCallOptions.key property

A key to prevent collision with other AsyncCalls. Can be anything, but need to be the same on the both side. This option is useful when you want to run multiple AsyncCall instances on the same message channel.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
key: string;
```

## Example

these two AsyncCall run on the same channel but they won't affect each other.

```ts
AsyncCall({}, { messageChannel, key: 'app1' })
AsyncCall({}, { messageChannel, key: 'app2' })

```

## AsyncCallOptions.thenable property

If the instance should be "thenable".

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
thenable?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

If the value is \*true\*, it will return a \*then\* method normally (forwards the call to the remote).

If the value is \*false\*, it will return \*undefined\* even the remote has a method called "then".

If the value is \*undefined\*, it will return \*undefined\* and show a warning. You must explicitly set this option to \*true\* or \*false\* to dismiss the warning.

The motivation of this option is to resolve the problem caused by Promise auto-unwrapping.

Consider this code:

```ts
async function getRPC() {
    return AsyncCall(...)
}

```
According to the JS semantics, it will invoke the "then" method immediately on the returning instance which is unwanted in most scenarios.
